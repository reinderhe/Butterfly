// (longshot) How many workers the shader preparation's first part runs on (vk_draw.cpp prepare_run: every program translated,
// and the driver's compile of each compute program's variants, for its cache).
//
// Half the CPUs (half_cpus), as before, unless the process heap is the segment heap (nx2/win_manifest.py's heapType). The
// driver's compiler allocates and frees from every worker at once, through the process heap: on the NT heap the workers queue
// on its one lock (sampled on AMD's Windows driver 26.10.1: amdvlk64.dll -> RtlAllocateHeap / RtlFreeHeap ->
// RtlEnterCriticalSection, 76% of the workers' samples waiting), so 12 workers on a 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 5600 kept 3.75
// CPUs busy and were slower than 6. On the segment heap 12 workers kept 11 busy, and the part took 904 s against 1,466 s
// with 6 on the NT heap (RX 6700 XT, a cold prepare). So with the segment heap every usable CPU gets a worker, as far as
// the free memory allows: each worker more held 0.4-0.5 GB more at the peak (6 more: 8.9 -> 11.3 GB private on one build,
// 9.0 -> 12.1 GB on another), and a worker is added only for each kPerWorkerMB free past kReserveMB. Without it (Linux, a
// Windows before 10 2004 that ignores the manifest, a build without it) the count is half_cpus, as before.
