# The Linux AppImage: Longshot Builder, its Python and Longshot's sources. No game data and nothing made from it is in it:
# the game is built from the player's own copy, as on Windows. Its build tools (the compiler, the sysroot, FFmpeg, SDL2,
# the Vulkan headers) are not in it either: they are tools.lock's linux-x64 lines, which the Longshot Launcher installs
# beside it, or the AppImage itself at its first start (builder/linux/linux_tools.py; docs/releases.md, "tools.lock").
#
#   scripts/linux/deps.sh        (first: Python, the AppImage packer, into build-linux/deps)
#   scripts/linux/appimage.sh    -> build-linux/Longshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage: the Linux builder a release ships, which
#                                   the Longshot Launcher installs (docs/releases.md)
# The same image builds the game and, with --play, starts the one it saved.
#
# The tools this build itself uses (clang for the Vulkan back end, the headers, the sysroot for the check below) are
# tools.lock's, installed into build-linux/tools ($TOOLS) by scripts/tools.py install, as the builder installs them.
# work/ (hot_funcs.txt, hot_order.txt, longshot_pieces.prof, image/chunks.txt: addresses and counts from playing, no game
# code) is carried along when it is there.
