# Game-free: a player's build started from what the AppImage carries, not from the repository. CI's AppImage job packages
# the builder but never builds a game with it, so a file the AppImage leaves out was found by every player instead: #1459
# made nx2/build.py write the menu's fonts from third_party/fonts at every build start, the AppImage does not carry that
# folder, and every Linux build stopped at LibertinusSans-Regular.ttf while CI stayed green (2026-11-10, #1567).
#
#   scripts/linux/check_player_build.sh [<Longshot-...-x86_64.AppImage>]   (default: the newest in build-linux/)
#
# The image is extracted, as its runtime does, and run with AppRun's own environment (the AppImage's Python and the prebuilt
# Vulkan back end, LONGSHOT_VK_PREBUILT; the build tools as builder/linux/linux_tools.py finds them, here tools.lock's in
# build-linux/tools ($TOOLS), given as the builder's toolchains folder for this version, so nothing is downloaded) in an
# otherwise empty one, so nothing of the checkout or of CI's caches stands in for what the image lacks:
#   - AppRun --cli --help: nx2/make_game.py, as --cli starts it (RecompLauncher's prepare);
#   - nx2/build.py --standalone --dry-run, as make_game.py runs it: its whole start-up up to the compile, which is where
#     the game's lifted code is first needed. Every other file the compile would read must be in the image. Once more with
#     AMD FSR 4 (LONGSHOT_FSR=1), which compiles the Vulkan back end from the image's sources and AMD's FSR API headers.
# Neither may write into the image's tree: on a player's PC it is read-only.
