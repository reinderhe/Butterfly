login is the team's one sign-in (magicbean_login.py: Sign in with Discord once, for the team chat and git together);
it is skipped when a git sign-in is saved already (--again redoes it). Then it:
  - makes this script git's credential helper for https://git.magicbean.dev (global git config, that host only), so
    git push, git fetch and jj git push sign in by themselves, the token renewed when it runs out;
  - adds the remote "forge" for MagicBeanDev/Longshot to the repository you run it in, unless one already points there
    (fetch from it; its main takes reviewed pull requests only, nobody pushes to it).
That is all reading, testing and test requests need. To send changes, fork sets up pushing: it makes your fork,
<you>/Longshot, if you have none, and adds the remote "forge-fork" for it (push your branches there). pr create does
the same when it hasn't been done. pr create opens a pull request from BRANCH on your fork into Longshot's main (push
the branch to your fork first: jj git push --remote forge-fork -b BRANCH, or git push forge-fork BRANCH). git calls
this script as "forge.py credential get|store|erase".

A pull request is work in progress until it is measured and ready for review (CONTRIBUTING.md, Commits and pull
requests): a title starting with "WIP: ", Forgejo's draft mark. pr create opens it so, with the description started
from .forgejo/pull_request_template.md when no --body or --body-file is given; --ready opens it ready, when the
description is complete already; it fills in the commits the Measurements name (main's: the merge base; this PR's:
the branch's head). pr ready takes WIP: off after the same check as the PR description workflow
(check_pr_description.py: every section filled in, the measurements named by commit, every For everyone box
ticked; the Flags note only warns), and refuses when it fails
(--force goes on with a warning); pr wip puts it back. The description is the PR as it is now, the comments its
history: pr update edits the description and posts a comment saying what changed in one step.

pr review posts one review: the verdict, a summary and comments on lines of the diff, each on the line of the PR's
version of the file (PATH:LINE), or of main's for a line the PR removes (PATH:-LINE; "old_line" in --inline's JSON,
a list of {"path", "line", "body"}). A line outside the diff's hunks is refused before anything is posted, since
Forgejo would put the comment on no line. A work-in-progress PR can be commented on, not approved. The verdict
follows what the review asks for: --request-changes for a change that has to land before the merge (a bug, a broken
rule), on a WIP PR too; --comment for questions and suggestions; --approve when it can merge as it is.
