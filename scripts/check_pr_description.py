"""Check a pull request's description against the template (.forgejo/pull_request_template.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
"Commits and pull requests"):

  - Why, What changed, Measurements, Testing and Risk and rollback there, filled in, none of the template's <...>
    stand-ins left;
  - Testing: its three parts, Tested, Not tested and Needs other testers, each filled in; Needs other testers is
    "None", or a line per thing with its test request (a T-XXXX id or a link) or "request to open";
  - Measurements: a table whose columns each name what they measured with its hash, never a bare Before and After:
    one the change ("this PR @ <hash>", or a named build that carries it), one the baseline ("main @ <hash>", or a
    named build). main against this PR needs nothing more; anything else says which column is the baseline in a
    "Baseline: <its column>" line. A main or this PR column comes with its "main: <hash> (<date>)" or "this PR:
    <branch> @ <hash>" line, on the same commit; and a row of values;
  - the checklist: every box of "For everyone" there and ticked. "If applicable" keeps only the boxes that apply
    (or is left out when none does), and every box kept is ticked: a box there means it applies, so it is done.

Warnings, which do not fail it: Flags and settings, a note on what the PR adds and the author's recommendation, never
a gate (missing, empty or with the template's stand-ins; a row missing a cell; an RX_*, HOS_* or LONGSHOT_* name the
diff adds that isn't listed; a change to the menu's code while it says None), a PR rebased onto a newer main than the
one measured, an If applicable box marked n/a (delete it instead), a box the diff suggests that isn't there, Not tested or Needs other testers naming something the Measurements say was
measured, and a test request still to open (forge.py pr ready refuses that one: the PR goes ready once they are open).

A pull request still in work in progress (a title starting with WIP: or [WIP], Forgejo's draft mark, or the API's
draft) is not checked: it passes with a notice listing what is left. The check applies once it is marked ready for
review; forge.py pr ready runs the same check before it takes the WIP: off.

    python -I scripts/check_pr_description.py --file body.md [--diff pr.diff] [--wip]
    python -I scripts/check_pr_description.py --pr 12 [--repo MagicBeanDev/Longshot] [--server https://git.magicbean.dev]

--pr reads the pull request and its diff from the Forgejo API, with the token in FORGEJO_TOKEN or GITHUB_TOKEN when one
is set (a public repository needs none). Exit status 0 when it passes, 1 with the problems listed when it does not.
Standard library only; .forgejo/workflows/pr-description.yml runs it on every pull request.
