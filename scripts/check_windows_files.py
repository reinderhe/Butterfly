"""The Windows Longshot Builder's release zip, checked as Windows files on the Linux runner that makes it
(.forgejo/workflows/build-windows.yml): what a build on Windows gave, and a build elsewhere could quietly lose. No game data is
involved. Python's standard library, and llvm-mingw's llvm-objdump and llvm-readobj.

    python -I scripts/check_windows_files.py --objdump <llvm-objdump> --readobj <llvm-readobj> <zip>
        the files (LongshotBuilder.exe, the setup, at the top; LongshotBuilder\\ the published builder, its setup copy, the
        tools), the setup's PE header, imports and resources (windres: its icon, manifest and version), the builder's apphost
        (GUI subsystem, so no console window, its version and manifest copied from the assembly) and its .NET (self-contained
        .NET 8, win-x64, and no WPF: the builder has no window)
    python -I scripts/check_windows_files.py --wine <wine> <zip>
        each started under Wine, nothing downloaded: the setup's --play of an empty folder ("error No built game to start"),
        the builder's --cli with no Python ("error The build tools could not start"). A sign that they load and their
        imports and .NET resolve, not a test of what they do (RELEASING.md, "Needs a Windows tester")

Prints what is wrong, and exits 1, when anything is.
