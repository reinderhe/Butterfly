"""Releases on git.magicbean.dev (docs/releases.md, RELEASING.md), for both products: Longshot (its builders, released from
MagicBeanDev/Longshot) and the Longshot Launcher (MagicBeanDev/LongshotLauncher). The same file is in both repositories; it
finds out which one it is in. Python's standard library, git, and the openssl command line (for keys and signatures) only.

A release is a Forgejo release of the repository: a tag, a page with the notes, and the product's files, with SHA256SUMS (each
file's SHA-256) and SHA256SUMS.sig (an ECDSA P-256 signature of SHA256SUMS by the release key, base64 DER). The channels are
read from the list of published releases: stable is the newest vX.Y.Z, rc the newest vX.Y.Z-rc.N or vX.Y.Z, nightly the
newest nightly-<count>-<commit>.

Versions and notes:
    python -I scripts/release.py next [--tag <tag>]
        the version the commits since the last stable call for (feat: minor, fix and perf: patch, ! or BREAKING CHANGE:
        major), the next release candidate's tag, and the notes git-cliff would write (a preview; nothing is changed)
    python -I scripts/release.py check-tag <tag> [--releases <releases.json>]
        refuses a tag that is not vX.Y.Z or vX.Y.Z-rc.N, not on main, not above every release there is, or lower than the
        commits since the last stable call for (CI runs it before it builds anything)
    python -I scripts/release.py nightly-name
        nightly-<commits since the product's first commit>-<8 hex of HEAD>: the nightly's version
    python -I scripts/release.py notes <tag> [--out <file>]
        the release notes: git-cliff with cliff.toml, over the commits since the tag before (of the product's numbers)
    python -I scripts/release.py git-cliff <folder>
        the pinned git-cliff (GIT_CLIFF below), downloaded and checked by its SHA-256 into <folder>; prints its path

Files and signatures:
    python -I scripts/release.py sums <file>... --out SHA256SUMS
    python -I scripts/release.py sign SHA256SUMS --key <private .pem> --out SHA256SUMS.sig
    python -I scripts/release.py verify SHA256SUMS [--sig SHA256SUMS.sig] [--pub <.pem>] [--files <folder>]
        the signature, by the key given or a key the launcher trusts (trusted_keys); with --files, every file's SHA-256 too
    python -I scripts/release.py keygen <out folder>
        a new ECDSA P-256 key pair, release.pem (private: keep it out of every repository) and release.pub.pem, and the lines
        for the launcher's Core/ReleaseTrust.cs and Longshot's scripts/release_keys.json
    python -I scripts/release.py key-id <.pem>

The release on Forgejo ($RELEASE_TOKEN: in CI the job's own token, forgejo.token; $GITHUB_REPOSITORY or the repository
this is; $FORGEJO_API, $FORGEJO_UPLOAD_API):
    python -I scripts/release.py publish <tag> --target <commit> --notes <file> <file>...
        a draft release (pre-release unless a stable), every file uploaded and checked, then published: until that last step
        no launcher sees it. A draft left by a failed run of the same tag is reused. The page is the notes under a header
        (release_page): the launcher's, big download links to its own files; Longshot's, "to play, get the Longshot
        Launcher", with longshot.magicbean.dev's links to the newest launcher of the same channel
    python -I scripts/release.py prune [--keep 5]
        the nightly releases and their tags past the newest <keep>; nothing else is ever deleted
    python -I scripts/release.py released-as <commit> [--not <tag>]
        the published release CI made of that commit (a nightly, or a release candidate under its stable), its SHA256SUMS
        signed by a key the launcher trusts and naming its every file; nothing when there is none. A release of the commit
        that fails those checks stops it
    python -I scripts/release.py channels
        what each channel offers now, as the launcher reads it
