"""A builder package with a Python of its own never runs another one.

With tools/python/python.exe gone (an antivirus took it, most often) both Windows builders started the tools with the
first "python" Windows found (issue 2045, item 10): another version, without the modules the tools need, or not one the
player chose to trust with the game files. Now the start fails and says how to get the package's Python back. Tools with no
python folder at all still use the PC's.

The Windows builder's Runner.cs is read for the rule.
