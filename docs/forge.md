# Working on git.magicbean.dev

Longshot lives on the team's Forgejo, [git.magicbean.dev/MagicBeanDev/Longshot](https://git.magicbean.dev/MagicBeanDev/Longshot).
Its `main` takes reviewed pull requests only. You work on branches of your own fork and open pull requests from there,
as on GitHub.

One sign-in covers everything on magicbean.dev: Forgejo signs people in with Discord, and the team chat (Matrix) asks
Forgejo who you are. So you sign in once, with **Sign in with Discord**, and git, the team chat and test requests all
use it. The first time creates your account.

## Set up once

From the repository folder:

```
python -I scripts/forge.py login
```

It prints a link and opens it: click **Sign in with Discord** and approve. Then it:

- adds the remote `forge` (MagicBeanDev/Longshot: fetch `main` from it, never push to it);
- becomes git's credential helper for git.magicbean.dev only, so `git push`, `git fetch` and `jj git push` sign in by
  themselves. The token renews itself when it runs out.

The sign-in is saved in your config folder (Linux `~/.config/longshot/`, Windows `%APPDATA%\Longshot\`), readable by
you only, never in the repository. `python -I scripts/forge.py whoami` shows who is signed in, and `logout` undoes it.

## Set up pushing

Reading, building and testing need only the sign-in. When you have something to send:

```
python -I scripts/forge.py fork
```

It makes your fork, `<you>/Longshot`, if you have none, and adds the remote `forge-fork` for it: push your branches
there. (`pr create` does this too if it hasn't been done.)

## A change, start to finish

```
jj git fetch --remote forge                                      (or: git fetch forge)
jj new main@forge -m "Fix the walls on Intel Arc"                (or: git switch -c fix-arc-walls forge/main)
... edit, build, test ...
jj bookmark create fix-arc-walls -r @
jj git push --remote forge-fork -b fix-arc-walls                 (or: git push forge-fork fix-arc-walls)
python -I scripts/forge.py pr create fix-arc-walls --title "fix(vk): walls missing on Intel Arc"
... measure, fill in the description ...
python -I scripts/forge.py pr update 12 --body-file pr.md --comment "Measured on an Arc A770: the table is in."
python -I scripts/forge.py pr ready 12
```

`pr create` prints the pull request's link. Title and description follow
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#commits-and-pull-requests). It opens the PR as **work in progress** (a `WIP: `
title, Forgejo's draft mark), with the description started from
[the template](../.forgejo/pull_request_template.md) when you give no `--body-file`, and main's and the branch's
commits filled in where the Measurements name them. `--ready` opens it ready, when the description is complete already
(`--draft`, the earlier flag, is now the default and still accepted).

## Work in progress, ready, and keeping the PR current

```
python -I scripts/forge.py pr ready 12 [--force]                 take WIP: off once the description passes the check
python -I scripts/forge.py pr wip 12 [--needs-measurements]      put WIP: back: it needs more work (the label: maintainers)
python -I scripts/forge.py pr edit 12 [--title T] [--body-file F]   the title or the description; WIP stays as it is
python -I scripts/forge.py pr update 12 [--body-file F] --comment "what changed and why"
python -I scripts/forge.py pr comment 12 ("text" | --body-file F)
python -I scripts/forge.py pr status 12                          WIP or ready, the check, the checklist, reviews, comments
python -I scripts/forge.py pr review 12 (--approve | --comment | --request-changes) [--body-file F] [--at PATH:LINE TEXT]...
```

- `pr ready` runs the PR description check (`scripts/check_pr_description.py`, the same one the `PR description`
  workflow runs) on the description and the PR's diff, and refuses while a section is empty or still holds the
  template's `<...>`, the Measurements don't name `main @ <hash>` and `this PR @ <hash>`, Testing lacks its Tested,
  Not tested or Needs other testers part, a test request is still "request to open", a *For everyone* box is
  missing or unticked, or an *If applicable* box kept is unticked (a box the diff suggests but that isn't there is a
  hint). It prints what is missing; `--force` goes on with a warning. Flags and settings is a note, never a reason
  to refuse: what it leaves out (a switch the diff adds and the table doesn't list, say) is a warning. `pr create`
  keeps only the *If applicable* boxes the diff suggests (none: the heading and a comment). It also takes off the label `needs measurements`.
- `pr update` is the "I pushed more" step: it edits the description (with `--body-file`) and posts the comment saying
  what changed, so the description stays the PR as it is now and the comments keep the history. With `--comment` only,
  it only comments.
- `pr edit` and `pr update` warn when a PR marked ready no longer passes the check: `pr wip` it if it needs more work.
- Take your PR out of WIP yourself (`pr ready`) as soon as it is complete: a WIP PR isn't reviewed, so it waits until
  you do. Forgejo shows a WIP PR as not mergeable, whether or not it needs a rebase.

## Reviewing a pull request

```
python -I scripts/forge.py pr checkout 12                         read it: jj diff -r pr/12, jj file show -r pr/12 <path>
python -I scripts/forge.py pr review 12 --request-changes --body-file review.md \
    --at gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp:3598 "This runs 64 lookups per draw: ..." \
    --at docs/old.md:-12 "Why remove this?"
python -I scripts/forge.py pr review 12 --comment --body-file review.md --inline comments.json
python -I scripts/forge.py pr review 12 --approve [--body "Looks right."]
```

One review: the verdict (`--approve`, `--comment` or `--request-changes`), a summary, and comments on lines of the
diff, which Forgejo shows beside those lines. `--at PATH:LINE TEXT` (repeatable) puts one on line LINE of the PR's
version of the file, `PATH:-LINE` on a line the PR removes (main's numbering). `--inline F` takes many from a JSON
file:

```json
[{"path": "gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp", "line": 3598, "body": "..."},
 {"path": "docs/old.md", "old_line": 12, "body": "..."}]
```

A line outside the diff's hunks is refused before anything is posted, since the comment would land on no line. The
review is tied to the PR's head commit, so a later push marks its comments outdated. A work-in-progress PR can be
commented on, not approved: it isn't measured yet.

Pick the verdict by what the review asks for:

- `--request-changes` when it asks for a change that has to land before the merge: a bug, a broken rule from
  CONTRIBUTING.md, a check that fails. Forgejo then shows the PR as blocked until the reviewer approves it. Use it on a
  work-in-progress PR too, so the author sees the blocker before marking the PR ready.
- `--comment` for questions and suggestions the author may take or leave.
- `--approve` when the PR can merge as it is. Nits may ride along as inline comments; a blocking change may not.

## Other commands

```
python -I scripts/forge.py pr list [--mine] [--state open|closed|all]
python -I scripts/forge.py pr view 12 [--comments]
python -I scripts/forge.py pr comment 12 "Tested on an RX 6700 XT: fixed."   (or --body-file F)
python -I scripts/forge.py pr checkout 12                         its head as the bookmark (jj) or branch (git) pr/12
python -I scripts/forge.py issue list [--label kind/bug]
python -I scripts/forge.py issue view 40 --comments
python -I scripts/forge.py issue create --title "..." --body-file issue.md
python -I scripts/forge.py issue comment 40 "..."
```

## fj, the Forgejo command line

For more than the above (reviews, labels, releases, browsing), install [fj](https://codeberg.org/forgejo-contrib/forgejo-cli/wiki/Installation):
a release binary for Windows or Linux, `cargo install --locked forgejo-cli`, `brew install forgejo-cli`, or your
distribution's `forgejo-cli` package.

fj's browser sign-in works only on servers it knows, and git.magicbean.dev isn't one of them, so give it a token: make one on
[git.magicbean.dev/user/settings/applications](https://git.magicbean.dev/user/settings/applications) (repository and
issue access), then run `fj -H git.magicbean.dev auth add-token` and paste it. Inside the repository, fj finds the host
from the remotes. For example, `fj pr create --base ^ "Title"` opens a pull request from your fork's branch into
Longshot.

## If something goes wrong

- `not signed in`, or git asks for a password: run `python -I scripts/forge.py login --again`.
- `no branch ... on <you>/Longshot`: push the branch to `forge-fork` first.
- A push to `forge` is refused: that is Longshot itself. Push to `forge-fork` and open a pull request.
